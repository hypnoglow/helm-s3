The Helm plugin that provides s3 protocol support.

This allows you to have private Helm chart repositories hosted on Amazon S3.

## Install

The installation itself is simple as:

    $ helm plugin install https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3.git

You can install a specific release version:

    $ helm plugin install https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3.git --version 0.6.1

To use the plugin, you do not need any special dependencies. The installer will
download versioned release with prebuilt binary from [github releases](https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3/releases).
However, if you want to build the plugin from source, or you want to contribute
to the plugin, please see [these instructions](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Note on AWS authentication

Because this plugin assumes private access to S3, you need to provide valid AWS credentials.
You can do this in [the same manner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) as for `AWS CLI` tool.

So, if you want to use the plugin and you are already using `AWS CLI` - you are
good to go, no additional configuration required. Otherwise, follow [the official guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
to set up credentials.

To minimize security issues, remember to configure your IAM user policies properly.
As an example, a setup can provide only read access for users, and write access
for a CI that builds and pushes charts to your repository.

**Example Read Only IAM policy**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example Read and Write IAM policy**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage

For now let's omit the process of uploading repository index and charts to s3 and assume
you already have your repository `index.yaml` file on s3 under path `s3://bucket-name/charts/index.yaml`
and a chart archive `epicservice-0.5.1.tgz` under path `s3://bucket-name/charts/epicservice-0.5.1.tgz`.

Add your repository:

    $ helm repo add coolcharts s3://bucket-name/charts

Now you can use it as any other Helm chart repository.
Try:

    $ helm search coolcharts
    NAME                       	VERSION	  DESCRIPTION
    coolcharts/epicservice	    0.5.1     A Helm chart.

    $ helm install coolchart/epicservice --version "0.5.1"

Fetching also works:

    $ helm fetch s3://bucket-name/charts/epicservice-0.5.1.tgz

### Init

To create a new repository, use **init**:

    $ helm s3 init s3://bucket-name/charts

This command generates an empty **index.yaml** and uploads it to the S3 bucket
under `/charts` key.

To work with this repo by it's name, first you need to add it using native helm command:

    $ helm repo add mynewrepo s3://bucket-name/charts

### Push

Now you can push your chart to this repo:

    $ helm s3 push ./epicservice-0.7.2.tgz mynewrepo

On push, both remote and local repo indexes are automatically updated (that means
you don't need to run `helm repo update`).

Your pushed chart is available:

    $ helm search mynewrepo
    NAME                    VERSION	 DESCRIPTION
    mynewrepo/epicservice   0.7.2    A Helm chart.

Note that the plugin denies push when the chart with the same version already exists
in the repository. This behavior is intentional. It is useful, for example, in
CI automated pushing: if someone forgets to bump chart version - the chart would
not be overwritten.

However, in some cases you want to replace existing chart version. To do so,
add `--force` flag to a push command:

    $ helm s3 push --force ./epicservice-0.7.2.tgz mynewrepo

To see other available options, use `--help` flag:

    $ helm s3 push --help

### Delete

To delete specific chart version from the repository:

    $ helm s3 delete epicservice --version 0.7.2 mynewrepo

As always, both remote and local repo indexes updated automatically.

The chart is deleted from the repo:

    $ helm search mynewrepo/epicservice
    No results found

### Reindex

If your repository somehow became inconsistent or broken, you can use reindex to recreate
the index in accordance with the charts in the repository.

    $ helm s3 reindex mynewrepo

## Uninstall

    $ helm plugin remove s3

## ACLs

In use cases where you share a repo across multiple AWS accounts,
you may want the ability to define object ACLS to allow charts to persist there
permissions across accounts.
To do so, add the flag `--acl="ACL_POLICY"`. The list of ACLs can be [found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl):

    $ helm s3 push --acl="bucket-owner-full-control" ./epicservice-0.7.2.tgz mynewrepo

You can also set the default ACL be setting the `S3_ACL` environment variable.

## Using alternative S3-compatible vendors

The plugin assumes Amazon S3 by default. However, it can work with any S3-compatible
object storage, like [minio](https://www.minio.io/), [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/)
and others. To configure the plugin to work alternative S3 backend, just define
`AWS_ENDPOINT` (and optionally `AWS_DISABLE_SSL`):

    $ export AWS_ENDPOINT=localhost:9000
    $ export AWS_DISABLE_SSL=true

See [these integration tests](https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3/blob/master/hack/integration-tests-local.sh#L10) that use local minio docker container for a complete example.

## Using S3 bucket ServerSide Encryption

To enable S3 SSE export environment variable `AWS_S3_SSE` and set it to desired type for example `AES256`.
